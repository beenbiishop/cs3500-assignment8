# Image Processor

_Smita Rosemary and Ben Bishop â€“ CS3500 Fall 2022, Northeastern University_

## Overview

This project represents an Image Processor that allows you to manipulate and enhance a given image.

The Image Processor allows a user to load an Image into the program, save it, and apply
transformations such as:

* Visualizing the red, blue, green, alpha, luma, or intensity channels of each pixel in an image as
  a greyscale image
* Vertically or horizontally flipping an image
* Brightening or darkening an image
* Blurring or sharpening an image
* Filtering an image to greyscale or sepia
* Applying a mosaic filter to an image
* Downscaling an image to a given width and height

The user can interact with the program in one of three ways:

1. Via the GUI interface (default - no args needed)
2. Via the command line interface
3. Via a script file

More details on interacting with the program can be found in the [USEME.md](USEME.md) file.

The program currently supports "PPM" images and any image type supported by the Java ImageIO
library. We guarantee support for "PNG", "JPG/JPEG", and "BMP" images. The program will
automatically detect the format to save to/load from based on the file extension.

We have provided three test images located in the `res` folder
named `ExampleImage.ppm`, `ExampleImage2.png`, and `ExampleImage3.png`. We have also processed this
image with all available commands to visualize transformations without running the program and saved
them to the subfolder `res/processed`
. `ExampleImage.ppm` was created by Smita Rosemary, and has been used with her
permission. `ExampleImage2.png` and `ExampleImage3.png` were created by Ben Bishop, and have been
used with his permission.

In the command line interface and the script file interface, the user can specify a mask to perform
a transformation only on certain areas of the source image. More information on this can be found in
the [USEME.md](USEME.md) file, but an example for each supported transformation is located in
the `res/masked` folder with the `ExampleMask1.png` mask appled to the `ExampleImage3.png` image.
The `ExampleMask1.png` mask was created by Ben Bishop, and has been used with his permission.

## How to Use

Instructions on how to use the program can be found in the [USEME.md](USEME.md) file.

## Changelog

### Assignment 8 (12/13/2022)

### Assignment 6 (11/22/2022)

_Third version. Retained all existing functionality, and added a new view, allowing the user to view
the program graphically rather than through text._

#### Changes

* Added `ImageUtils` class in order to encompass various utility methods used throughout the
  program.
    * `getBufferedImage` method to convert an `Image` to a `BufferedImage`
    * `getChannelFrequencies` method to get the frequency of each color channel in an image
* Added support for a GUI (graphical user interface) mode that allows all functionality to be
  performed without any user interaction via the terminal
    * Added `ImageProcessorGuiImpl` class (implements `ImageProcessorGui`) to represent the new GUI
      view (extends the previously existing `ImageProcessor` interface)
    * Added `ImageProcessorGuiControllerImpl` class (implements `ImageProcessorGuiController`) to
      represent the controller for the GUI view
    * Added various panel classes to represent the various panels in the GUI view. Each panel extend
      various swing component classes to wrap the creation and interaction in simpler public
      methods.
        * `HistogramPanel` class to represent the histogram preview panel
        * `MenubarPanel` class to represent the menu bar

  extensibility more dynamic. Updated the `ImageProcessorControllerImpl`
  and `ImageProcessorViewImpl` classes to reflect this change.
* Updated the `ImageProcessorRunner` class to support the new GUI view as the default, and modified
  the method of running the program in a text view.

### Assignment 5 (11/10/2022)

_Second version. Retained all existing functionality, and added support for new transformations and
the ability to run from a script file._

#### Changes

* Added support for blurring, sharpening, and applying a sepia or greyscale filter to an image.
    * Added more implementations of the `ImageTransformation` interface in the model (`Blur`
      , `Sharpen`, `Sepia`, and `Greyscale`) to apply these filters to `Image`s.
    * Added a new implementation of the `ImageProcessorCmd` interface in the controller
      (`FilterCmd`) to handle the execution of the `blur`, `sharpen`, `sepia`, and `greyscale`
      commands.
    * Modified the `addCommands` method in the `ImageProcessorControllerImpl` class to add the four
      new commands to the map of supported commands.
    * Updated the `renderMenu` method in the `ImageProcessorViewImpl` to include the new filters in
      the menu.
    * Added new test methods in both the `ImageControllerTest` and `ImageTransformationTest` classes
      to test the new commands.
    * Added new example images in the `res/processed` folder to demonstrate the new filters.
* Added a new higher-resolution example image in the `res` folder (`ExampleImage2.png`) to make
  visualization of the new filters easier.
* Added support for loading and saving images from more conventional file formats
    * Added a new implementation of the `ImageFileHandler` interface in the
      controller (`ImageIOHandler`) to handle loading and saving images using the Java ImageIO
      library. This library supports a wide variety of image formats, including "png", "jpg", "jpeg"
      , and "bmp". These four formats are guaranteed to be supported by the program, but others may
      be as well.
    * Modified the `LoadCmd` and `SaveCmd` classes to check the file format of the image to be
      loaded/saved and use the `ImageIOHandler` if it is not a "ppm" image.
    * Added new test methods in the `ImageControllerTest` class to test loading/saving images using
      the new file formats.
* Added support for loading and running a script file as a command line option.
    * Modified the `ImageProcessorRunner` class to check for the presence of
      the `-script <script text file>` command line option, and fallback to the standard CLI if it
      is not present.
* Updated the test methods in the `ImageProcessorViewImplTest` class to ensure the new menu is
  displayed.
* Added support for running the program from a JAR file (see [USEME.md](USEME.md) for details).
    * Added a new `MANIFEST.MF` file to the `META-INF` folder to specify the main class of the
      program.
    * Built the program into a JAR file located at `res/ImageProcessor.jar`.
* Updated the `README.md` file to include more information about the image processor and the new
  features implemented in this version.
* Created a new `USEME.md` file to document how to use the program.

#### Bug Fixes

* `ImagePPMHandler`
    * Fixed that the `process` method would throw an exception if the file was empty.
    * Fixed that the `process` method did not close scanners it opened.
* `Visualize`
    * Replaced typecasting with rounding in the `transform` method to result in more accurate
      transformations.
* Cleaned up JavaDoc comments to be more consistent and accurate.
* Cleaned up error messages to be more consistent and accurate.

## Class Overview

### Controller

* Interfaces
    * `ImageProcessorController` : Represents a controller for the image processor. As the user
      inputs commands, the controller validates the parameters and executes them. The controller
      also handles the exceptions thrown by the model and view, and displays them as messages to the
      user via the view.
        * Implementations:
            * `ImageProcessorControllerImpl`: Implements the `ImageProcessorController` interface
              supporting the above transformation commands as well as `load`, `menu`, and `save`.
    * `ImageProcessorCmd` : Represents a supported command that the image processor can handle. The
      command is executed by calling the `execute` method, and implemented subclasses of this
      interface will handle the execution of the command
        * Implementations:
            * `MenuCmd` : Implements the `ImageProcessorCmd` and represents the `menu` command
              offered by the processor.
